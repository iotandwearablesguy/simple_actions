A project template for Rust, helping to structure your projects according to best practices and avoid doing the same setup time and again.

## Features

- Suitable for both a binary or library project
- Structured according to both Git and Rust best practices
  - Includes readme, license, changelog, gitignore and gitattributes
  - Extensive Cargo manifest
  - [Separation of concerns for binary projects](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch12-03-improving-error-handling-and-modularity.html?highlight=separation,concerns#separation-of-concerns-for-binary-projects)
- Multiplatform support - The template is compatible with Linux, MacOS and Windows
- WebAssembly support
  - Conditionally includes `console_error_panic_hook` improving browser error messages.
  - Conditionally includes `wee_alloc` for a smaller memory footprint.
  - Dedicated `README_WEB.md` for WebAssembly usage and building instructions
- Continuous Integration support with Github Actions
  - Rust: Triggers the following on every push or pull request, using the latest stable toolchain:
    - `cargo fmt`: Ensure uniform code formatting
    - `cargo clippy`: Ensure idiomatic code
    - `cargo check`: Ensure compilation succeeds on Linux, MacOS, Windows and WebAssembly
    - `cargo test`: Run all tests
    - `cargo bench`: Run all benchmarks
  - Release: Create a new GitHub Release draft when a tag starting with `v` is pushed.
  - Publish: Automated publishing of binary assets for a GitHub Release:
    - Build binaries for Linux, MacOS, Windows and WebAssembly
    - Archive binaries with a license, readme and appropate files for each platform
    - Upload archives as assets for the appropriate GitHub release

## Download

Available releases can be downloaded for your platform of choice on the [Releases](https://github.com/zaszi/rust-template/releases) page. These are merely provided as an example on how the asset uploading works, and aren't actually useful by themselves beyond what a `hello world` program can provide.

## Usage

To tailor the template to your specific needs, simply go over the following
checklist:

1. The template assumes a binary project by default. If you require a library project:
   1. Uncomment Cargo.lock in `.gitignore`.
   1. Remove `src/main.rs`.
   1. Remove `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
1. Update `Cargo.toml` with the correct information for your project.
1. Change the name inside the `LICENSE` file, or replace with a license of your choice.
1. Update this `README.md` and `README_WEB.md` (do not forget to replace URLs).
1. Update the `CHANGELOG` as you add to your project.

## Building

If desired, you can build Rust-template yourself. You will need a working `Rust` and `Cargo` setup. [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is the simplest way to set this up on either Windows, Mac or Linux.

Once the prerequisites have been installed, compilation on your native platform is as simple as running the following in a terminal:

```
cargo build --release
```

## WebAssembly

Rust-template supports running as WebAssembly in the browser. See the [web readme](README_WEB.md) for instructions.

## License

Rust-template itself is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE) and includes this as the default project license.
