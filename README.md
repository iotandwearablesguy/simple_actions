<p align="center">A GUI driven simple demo in RUST that reads a CSV file of all the US Cities and their LAT/LONGs. Choosing two random cities each time it's run from the list of cities in the CVS file. The distance between those two cities is calculated using the great circle method and then display through GTK dialog box with various buttons.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

_Cavaet_ : Those viewing this repo for the first time may be horrified by the color choices in the css.  As the author I am not of an artistic nature and need to correct the css for better visual appeal.

### How it works

  1. Main function begins here which calls for the UI creation.
 
  2. build_ui uses the grid layout method from gtk to build the GUI.
    
    a. build_ui call the style.css file for the colors and font styles in the app.
    
    b. build_ui makes "Two Random Cities" button active.
    
    c. "Two Random Cities" is a connected_active button from gtk4 using the module of the same name.

 3. connect_active call on the greatcircle function.
 
  a. fn greatcircle call on the rand crate to generate two random numbers

  b. fn greatcircle next reads the comma separated values file uscities matching the city_id to the random numbers generated.

  c. the data for these two selected cities is stored in the struct CityData
  
  d. fn greatcircle then returns the two cities with their respective states and the distance between the in the struct answer.

 4. The struct answer is passed back to build_ui, and displayed on the screen as text in the variable label.
 
  a. build_ui monitors the buttons labeled "Quit" and "Close" which both kill the app.

  b. the "Hello World" button prints the test 'Hello World' in the terminal window.

  c. the "Hello Again" button prints the test 'Hello World Again' in the terminal window.

  d. build_ui then loops back to allow a second choice.

## Features

The demo is built using the *container* method, where each block of the GUI is built within a *container*.


### Build
  
Build using the "cargo run" command.

### Docs
  
Using "cargo doc" generates the documentation in the .../src/target/docs directory.


### Debug
  
Automatically sets up debugging on the MacOS using VScode and LLDB Code extensions.

#### Prerequisites

Need Vscode with extensions: 
    - rust-analyzer
    - code lldb
